# Retro Game Platform UI

This project is a frontend UI concept for a retro-themed hackathon platform, designed with pixel art aesthetics and a nostalgic 1980s vibe. It was created for the Frontend UI Hackathon 2025.

## Overview

This UI features several key sections:

* **Homepage (HACK NOW):** A landing page with a hero image, latest updates, and featured challenges.
* **Leaderboard:** Displays a mock leaderboard of top participants.
* **Collection:** Showcases a collection of pixel art collectible items with interactive details.
* **Rules:** Outlines the hackathon rules in a simple list.
* **Profile:** Presents a user profile with a custom avatar and collected badges.

The UI is built using HTML, CSS (with a custom pixel font and styling), and basic JavaScript for navigation and interactive elements.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Pixel Art Assets (located in the `assets/` folder)
